This R script uses the Census API to pull survey data from the American Community Survey (ACS). 

To run this script, you will need a free Census API token. You can follow this guide here: [https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html](url).

If you're interested in learning more about the Census API, I recommend Dr. Kyle Walker's introductory text: [https://walker-data.com/census-r/](url)
