These R scripts use the Census API to pull statistics data from the American Community Survey (ACS). 

To run this script, you will need a free Census API token: [https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html](url).

If you're interested in learning more about the Census API, I recommend Dr. Kyle Walker's introductory text: [https://walker-data.com/census-r/](url)
